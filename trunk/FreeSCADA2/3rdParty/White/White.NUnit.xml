        <member name="T:White.NUnit.Verify">
            <summary>
            Allows you to perform verifications in your tests. This does the same thing as the corresponding Assert methods in NUnit do, only difference being 
            it doesn't stop the test at that point. Since functional tests are long running tests, hence one would want to know about all the failures in the 
            in one go. One should still use NUnit Assert directly in situations where there is no point in proceeding with the test.

            <summary>
            This should be called at the end of every test so that the failures of one test should not appear as failure on other tests.

            Executes user provided method but does not stop the test if the Assertion fails

        <member name="P:White.NUnit.Verify.TestFailed">
            <summary>
            Check whether the test failed or succeeded. This would get reset to false when CleanUp is called.

            <summary>
